# PREDICTING ABSENTEEISM OF EMPLOYEES AT WORKPLACE USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION & GRADIENT BOOSTING ALGORITHM

## Abstract 
Workplace absenteeism plays a key role in demonstrating a company's efficient and profitable ability. Thus, the understanding of employee absenteeism becomes the principle for a company across its different aspects. Since the right assessment of the profile of workers allows such illnesses to be detected by excesses of occurrences. The primary aim of the early absenteeism analysis was to predict the characteristics and groups of employee absence and the reason of absence that make them implement superior absenteeism at work. However, it is still to be explored to forecast the absenteeism period of workers using machine learning classifiers and thus to find out the evidence that should be considered to minimize higher absenteeism at work. We now use two prominent machine learning algorithms in this project, namely Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting, to predict employee absenteeism time and to discover the insights that prompt employees to perform greater absenteeism at work. Through this we have also find the probability of an employee of being absent at the workplace based on evocative parameters. Therefore to find out the best classifier that delivers the maximum prediction accuracy, compare the various machine learning algorithms. We used an existing dataset of a courier organization in Brazil to determine the amount of time of employees' absenteeism. Similarly, we have also crafted a threshold assessment of the extreme and normal absenteeism grounded on the hours absent at workplace. Using the machine learning algorithm, we revealed that the best facts of exhibiting higher absenteeism at work are the justification for absence class as diseases corroborated by the International Code of Diseases (ICD) and the transportation cost from home to work. 

## Description of the Dataset
The dataset we used in this study was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which was created from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil with records of employee absenteeism at work. Firstly, the Universidade Nove de Julho Postgraduate Program in Informatics and Information Management used the dataset for their academic study. The data is consisting of the 700 Rows with 12 Attributes namely ID, Reason for Absence, Date, Transportation Expense, Distance to Work, Age, Daily Work Load Average, Body Mass Index, Education, Children, Pets, Absenteeism Time in Hours. The International Code of Diseases (ICD) attests to the absence of diseases in 21 groups.
